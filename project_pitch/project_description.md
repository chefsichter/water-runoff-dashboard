### [C3] Exploring water runoff trends in Switzerland with AI and interactive dashboards 

**Description**: In a recent study, we created a dataset of water runoff for Switzerland using a deep-learning-based modeling approach. This dataset provides daily runoff estimates from 1963 to 2023 with complete spatial and temporal coverage; an advantage over traditional runoff measurements, which are only available at limited locations. This dataset is valuable for understanding long-term water availability, drought patterns, and climate impacts on hydrology. Since runoff is closely linked to meteorological factors such as precipitation and temperature, the dataset also allows us to explore these relationships over time. The goal of this challenge is to analyze, visualize, and extract insights from this spatiotemporal dataset. Students will have the opportunity to either: 1) Develop an interactive dashboard to explore runoff trends and patterns, or 2) use machine learning to identify links between runoff trends and catchment characteristics. No prior hydrological knowledge is required; students will primarily focus on data analysis, visualization, and ML/AI techniques. 

**Target Users:** 1) Researchers and environmental scientists studying climate impacts and water resources. 2) Policymakers and water managers monitoring long-term water availability. 3) Farmers and agricultural planners assessing drought risks. 

**Tasks:** Participants will: 1) Familiarize themselves with the dataset and understand how to work with spatiotemporal data. 2) Analyze runoff trends over time and across different regions using statistical or machine learning methods. 3) Choose one of the following: Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize runoff trends, meteorological influences, and spatial patterns, or use machine learning to establish relationships between catchment properties and runoff trends using machine learning. 

**Data:** cAccess: Download the dataset here: https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000714281. Format: 1) NetCDF file: Contains daily modeled runoff, meteorological variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature), and static catchment properties. 2) Shapefile (ESRI format): Contains catchment outlines, which can be linked to the NetCDF file via an object ID. The data is already preprocessed and structured, but students will need to learn how to extract and analyze the relevant information. 

**Supervision & Involvement:** To be discussed with the students. Regular meetings are not mandatory, but irregular check-ins can be arranged for guidance and troubleshooting 

**Team Expertise & Requirements:** Python experience is recommended (e.g., handling data with Pandas, visualizing with Matplotlib, or using machine learning libraries). No prior experience with spatiotemporal data or hydrology is required; students will learn as they go
